The Drowsy Snapper!!

This magnificent project that I created will snap a pic of you if, and only if, your eyes are shut. (Remember, the event itself was titled 'Useless Projects')

Team Name: 
Artemis

Team Member(s):
Judge, Jury and Executioner - Aman Nazar, SOE CUSAT (aka, it was a solo venture)

Project Description:
It can be used to click a pic of a person when the user has their eyes closed for more than 15 frames.

The Nonexistent Problem:
Remember that time you took a group photo with your friends, and in the pic, your eyes were closed? Haven't you always wanted to recreate that? Exactly.

The Unnecessary Solution:
This project can be used to do that. Also, while doing the project(or rather, while scouring the internet), I realized that it can be 're-'purposed as a drowsiness checker. So, after some minor tweaks here and there, we have just that- a tool to measure drowsiness. Of course, if you want to completely disregard any newfound use of my hard work, one can always tweak those variables back. I wouldn't recommend that.

Technologies Used:
Python, OpenCV, NumPy, dlib.
