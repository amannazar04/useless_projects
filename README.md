# The Drowsy Snapper!! ðŸŽ¯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Artemis


### Team Members
Judge, Jury and Executioner: Aman Nazar - Studying at SOE, CUSAT (aka a solo venture)


### Project Description
It can be used to click a pic of a person when the user has their eyes closed for more than 15 frames.


### The Nonexistent Problem:
Remember that time you took a group photo with your friends, and in the pic, your eyes were closed? Haven't you always wanted to recreate that? Exactly.


### The Unnecessary Solution:
This project does that. Also, while doing the project(or rather, while scouring the internet), I realized that it can be 're-'purposed as a drowsiness checker. So, after some minor tweaks here and there, we have just that- a tool to measure drowsiness. Of course, if you want to completely disregard any newfound use of my hard work, one can always tweak those variables back. I wouldn't recommend that.
